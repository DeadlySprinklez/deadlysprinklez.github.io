		this page loads insanely fast
		given it's only a character set,
		a title tag, and a one-line script
		(and of course, this comment too)
		so it's incredibly unlikely that
		you'd ever see this comment,
		unless your network speed is
		painfully slow, or unless you're
		on the github page. if you see
		this, DM me the thirtieth word
		in this comment on Discord.
		love you
