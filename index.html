  <div id="mainpart">Hello! As you may know, I am DeadlySprinklez, a 12 (and a half)-year-old gamer. I'd like to announce that this website is entirely 100% <b>handmade</b> by me. Up above you'll see the navbar, where you can access my news document, go back to my channel, or alternatively bring yourself right back here. Eventually I will learn to use GitHub, and make an entire branching website! Look forward to that!</b></div>
