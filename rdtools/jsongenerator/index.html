		</div><br><br id="getting-started">
		<div class="page">
			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			To start, you should have either a pre-existing .json file, or a .png spritesheet! Most spritesheets are vertical, but with a recent update they can be actual sheets now - with both verticality AND horizon...tality? They can go both up and down and side to side.<br>
			As an example, we'll be using <span class="highlight">MarioMak967#6308</span>'s Logun sprite, reworked by RD developer <span class="highlight">giacomo</span> for the sake of demonstration.<br>
			<img src="assets/help/logun2.png" class="example">
			To begin with, we'll upload the spritesheet. To do so, click on the Browse... button and find your spritesheet!
			<div class="hint"><span class="highlight">TIP:</span> You can also click and drag the file from your file browser onto the Browse... button.</div><br>
			Next to your Browse... button should be the name of the spritesheet. It should look like this!<br>
			<img src="assets/help/fileUpload.png" class="example">
			If all goes well, the image should go through and the tool will pick it up and analyze it a bit. Computer magic! It should grab the size of a <i>single frame</i> automatically. If it's not able to find either the width or the height of the frame, it'll pop up with an error message saying it wasn't able to find one or the other! Don't worry - the tool isn't broken if this happens. If you hit the OK button, you can have it <span class="highlight">autofill the image's width (X) OR height (Y) as a fallback</span>; this helps with purely vertical and horizontal spritesheets, since those are perfectly made to fit the image's width or height respectively. If this doesn't apply to you, you can hit the cancel button and fill those values in yourself.
			<div class="hint"><span class="highlight">TIP:</span> If you don't know what you're doing, you can always contact me or others for help! My Discord tag is <span class="highlight">DeadlySprinklez#4327.</span></div><br>
			Now the first three inputs should look like this!<br>
			<img src="assets/help/postUpload.png" class="example">
			<div class="hint">Note that the frame size does not need to be the same for both X and Y - it just so happens that the logun sprite is completely square!</div>
			<div class="hint">Also, pay attention to the red text - this will be the name of your .json file! It needs to be the same name as your spritesheet!</div>
			Now we can move on to the final part of the JSON and character creation - the expressions! Below the Frame Size input should be the Clips section, with four pre-made and non-deletable slots: neutral, happy, barely, and missed. Before we get into those, you need to know a few things.<br><br>
			Frames are <span class="highlight">zero-indexed</span>, which means that the first frame on the spritesheet is actually the 0th frame. This is because computers commonly use zero as the first digit - so if you want to use your first frame, second frame, third frame, and fourth frame in that order, it would go into the frame input box as "0, 1, 2, 3".<br>
			Another thing is that there exists a such thing as 0 FPS, or 0 frames per second, in the game. This makes it so that sprites advance to the next frame on <span class="highlight">every quarter beat</span> but <span class="highlight">this will only work with the Loop on beat option selected</span>. If the loop on beat option isn't selected, having 0 FPS will mess up the animation.<br><br>
			Now that we know these things, we can get to filling in the different slots in an expression! The "neutral" expression is what plays when the character isn't reacting to a hit or a miss - it's their <span class="highlight">idle, waiting state</span>. The "happy" expression is what plays when the player <span class="highlight">hits a beat properly</span> on the character's row. The "barely" and "missed" expressions play when the player makes a <span class="highlight">small</span> or <span class="highlight">big mistake</span>, respectively.<br><br>
			With that out of the way, you're on the last few steps of making your first custom character! There's not much that I can do to help you here - it's all up to you now. If you want to see a preview of your sprite and your animation, click the <img src="assets/play button.png" style="width:12px;height:12px;"> yellow play button on the right of each expression! Other than that, once you're done click on the <span class="highlight">Export + Download JSON</span> button, save the file in the same place as your spritesheet, and import your custom character by going into the Level Editor, going into the blue Rows tab, adding a new row, and clicking on the folder button next to the character dropdown box!<br>
			<img src="assets/help/inEditor.png" class="example">
			Once you've done that, you've done it! You've made a custom character! If it comes out looking glitched or messed up, don't worry - everybody messes up sometimes. Just jump to <a href="#"><span class="highlight" onclick="document.getElementById('troubleshooting').scrollIntoView()">Troubleshooting</span></a> or contact anyone with the RD Editor Helper role on the 7th Beat Games' official Discord server, <a href="https://discord.gg/rhythmdr">Rhythm Doctor Lounge</a>.
		</div><br><br id="advanced-mode">
		<div class="page">
			<h2>Advanced Mode</h2>
			When you're just starting out with character creation, there are rules you need to follow. The minimum and default inputs of nine shows that <span class="highlight">sprites should have <b>four pixels of transparency</b> on <b>all four sides of each sprite</b></span>, and <span class="highlight">the first four expressions are needed for basic functionality.</span> At the time of the tool's creation, I thought of nothing past these standards.<br>
			However, a chat with <span class="highlight">saladplainzone</span>, one of the admins of Rhythm Doctor Lounge and a friend of mine, showed that there are circumstances where those standards don't need to be followed. So, Advanced Mode was born!<br>
			Advanced Mode, despite the name, is quite simple in nature. All it does is it allows for <span class="highlight">any number</span> to be entered into both the frame X and frame Y input boxes, and it allows you to <span class="highlight">modify and delete the first four preset expressions</span> as if they were just expressions you added yourself. However, this also disables the spritesheet analyzing function, and you will have to enter the size values yourself. With the new cropping preview, this will be a lot easier.<br>
			<span class="highlight">NOTE:</span> YOU CAN STILL UPLOAD A SPRITESHEET FOR ANIMATION PREVIEWS AND FOR REFERENCE. The functions for automatically grabbing the size values are turned off, nothing else. 
			<br>
			Also note! Disabling Advanced Mode will <span class="highlight">only restore functionality to the frame input boxes</span>. If you deleted any of the first four expressions, they will need to be remade manually which will allow you to retain all of your progress so far, or you will have to reload the page which will mean you will lose any new expressions you created.
		</div><br><br id="troubleshooting">
		<div class="page">
			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<h4>My sprite looks glitched/squished!</h4>
			This is likely due to using a sheet format on an outdated editor/preorder build of the game! Make sure you're up to date, or if the latest stable version for the preorder is still 0.6.1, use the beta. If that's not the issue, your frame size is likely wrong! Try tweaking it and using the Play preview on the site.
			<h4>My sprite constantly slides like it was tiled!</h4>
			Either your frame X or your frame Y is wrong! Sometimes the frame size algorithm performs poorly - it's more there for convenience and not to be relied on. If you need help finding the actual frame X or Y, ask for help on <a href="https://discord.gg/rhythmdr">Rhythm Doctor Lounge</a> - 7th Beat Games' official Discord server.
			<h4>I have my FPS set to 0 but my character is much slower than a frame every quarter beat!</h4>
			Make sure you have Loop set to <span class="highlight">Loop on beat</span>! If you have it set to Loop at end, your frames will go a lot slower and will not loop correctly. Be warned!
			<h4>My problem isn't listed here...</h4>
			That's definitely not good, then! DM me on Discord (<span class="highlight">DeadlySprinklez#4327</span>) and I can help you out right away, or, if it's an issue with the tool itself, DM me on Discord or post an issue on the <span class="highlight">Github Issue Tracker</span> and I'll be sure to take care of it immediately and let you know when it's fixed.
